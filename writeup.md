# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** 

### Reflection

### 1.  Describe your pipeline:

#### My pipeline consisted of 6 steps. <br />
   Started with the original image:<br />
<img src="pipeLine-screenshots/1.original_image.jpg" width="480" />

*  First, I converted the original images to grayscale, so that I can apply Canny algorithm.
<img src="pipeLine-screenshots/2.gray_image.jpg" width="480" />
*  Second, applied Gaussian filter to grayscaled image to filter-out noise and spurious gradients.
<img src="pipeLine-screenshots/3.blur_gray.jpg" width="480" />
*  Third, applied the apply canny algorithm on the above image.
<img src="pipeLine-screenshots/4.canny_edges.jpg" width="480" />
*  Fouth, 
created polygon mask.
<img src="pipeLine-screenshots/5.mask.jpg" width="480" />
created a masked image.
<img src="pipeLine-screenshots/6.masked_image.jpg" width="480" />
created a canny masked image.<br />
<img src="pipeLine-screenshots/7.masked_canny_edges.jpg" width="480" />
<br />
*  Fifth, calulated Hough lines from canny edges.
<img src="pipeLine-screenshots/8.HoughLines_Drawn.jpg" width="480" /><br />

The hough_lines() function internally calls draw_lines() function to draw the lines to the full extent. The lines returned from hough_lines() function are drawn on the bases of edges/dots returned from canny algorithm. So, basicaly lines will only be drawn on the pixels which has qualified certain threshold of pixel intensity. Therefore, if the current pipeline watches a unbroken any-color lane-lines then it will annotate it, but if it the lane-lines are broken, which they are on roads, then they will only recognise the any-color broken patches.<br />

Here,
<br />
**The goal now is to draw a consistent annotation on the lane lines irrespective of whether it is broken or not.**<br />

>  In order to draw a single annotation on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function as follows
>  1. We got an image with hough lines drawn from hough_lines() function. 
>  2. Seperate the left-lane lines & right-lane lines from the lines returned from hough_lines() function. We can perform 
   it by finding slope of each line and checking under the ~~condition whether it's <0 or >0,~~ respectively put the lines
   in left-lane lines, right-lane lines list.
>>   *  **I observed that there were no verticle lines(slope Infinity) detected in any image. But, can't find a solid reason           for it.
      May be Hough transformation has excluded them because, these lines are parallel to y-axis and will never meet.
      But, I can defend against this point that, these lines could intersect with many other +ve or -ve slope lines,
      then they are significant.**
>>   ~~* **I found few Horizontal lines. I have seperated them into left-lane lines & right-lane lines on the basis of a 
      condition <500 & >500 respectively**~~
>  3. After finding the left-lane lines & right-lane lines. I followed the follow points. Consider now only left-lane lines
>>   * ~~First find out minimum of all y's.~~
>>   * ~~Now, Calculate minimum of x for the minimum y, `Oops...!` You do not know Intercept & slope. Follow the below steps:~~
>>   * Calculate average slope among all left-lane lines,
>>>     *  find the average of all `(x1,y1,x2,y2)` coordinates to get (x1_avg,y1_avg,x2_avg,y2_avg)
>>>     *  Now, calculate `slope_avg = (y2_avg - y1_avg) / (x2_avg - x1_avg)`
>>   * Calculate average Intercept,
>>>      *  `intercept_avg = y1_avg - (slope_avg * x1_avg)`
>>   * Now you have all the tools `x1_avg, y1_avg, slope_avg, intercept_avg` ~~to calculate `minimum of x for minimum y` point          by using:~~
         ~~`min_x = (y_min - intercept_avg) / slope_avg`~~
>  4. ~~Now, we have `(min_x, min_y)` among all left-lane lines and we can calculate `(max_x, max_y)` similarly by following         the above algorithm.~~
~~Next step is to find `(min_x, min_y) & (max_x, max_y)` for right-lane lines from the above steps.~~
<br />
*  Sixth, To achive the goal to get a consistent line on both lanes connect & color above lines with cv2.line() function.

Later, made the annotation semi-transpared by using cv2.addWeighted() function.

### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline<br />

* Putting annotations manually.
* even after annotating manually, I didn't exact match to lane-lines
* What if I want to change lanes, on a 6/8 lane road. My pipeline will never be able to change lanes. Not written code for detecting 8 lanes together. But, we can do this by increasing the mask region/by changing the shape of it(more complicated.)
* The canny edge detection was so good that it was able to detect the car edges which was in the frame. If somehow we can extract those features and put some condition on them. We can detect vehicles infront of our Autonomous car.
* There is no code present to mantain speed  <br />

---

### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline <br />

* I think I can detect car edges, road signs by putting filters for each category. Later, I can pass it to my piplelines which will process them on the fly.

* I can also detect numbers on the Road Symbols and can write a code to increase/ decrease speed.

* I can defineatly avoid manual annotation.  <br />

### 4. Questions to Evaluator? <br />

* When I kept the slope condition as <br />

* The following were the points selected for annotation.<br />

<br />
Now, I fix the x's and y's manually for annotation to get the following:<br />

<br />

**My question to you is,** <br />
* Why restricting more the slope conditions in 2nd approach has changed the result. Logically, what I was doing in approach 1st is same. When I have restricted the whole area to draw line on the canny-image, then there is no point at all for the inclusion of noise(wrong slopes from anywhere). Then, Why a forum instructor has suggested me to restrict slope.???<br />

* I tried my best with this:<br />
After getting hough lines,here I have both left and right lanes in it. <br />
> * 1st I seperated them into left and right lanes.( it will be fine, once I get explaination for my 1st question above)
> * Later, I averaged into each category.( I'm okay with this)
> * Finally I fixed manually y's and get x's for each left and right lane.( not okay to fix manually )
> * then I have draw seperate line using these fixed min-max x's and y's for left and right.<br />

Why I have to fix them manually, when through logic what I was doing before, that from the pool of left and right lines, I extracted the minimum and the maximum y's(of all y1, y2 's) then<br />
>> * Either, I extracted the corresponding minimum and maximum y's detected from above stem in the list of lists I am maintaining the left/right lines.
>> * or I used slope intercept form to calculate minimum and maximum x's from above y's.
<br />
IN BOTH OF THE APPROACHES I WAS NOT ABLE TO GET A GOOD ANNOTATION. MOREOVER, I INVESTED A LOT OF TIME IN EXPRESSING MY QUESTION TO FORUM MENTORS/ASSIGNED MENTOR, BUT NEVER GOT A CLEAR ANSWER.<br />

* 3rd question to reviewer is in regards to challenge video, Can I changes the fixed x's & y's for the challenge video, As I can see in the video generated in the folder, the annotations were misplaced. So My question is, Are you looking for some universal x's / y's that once fixed can be generalised to any image to annotate Lane lines or we have to adjust for every image/video.?
<br />
<br />
IT'S A REQUEST TO THE EVALUATOR TO PLEASE ANSWER THEM, WHICH WILL HELP TO KNOW WHY I WAS WRONG IF I AM..??
